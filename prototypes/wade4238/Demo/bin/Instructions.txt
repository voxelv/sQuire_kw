Run Server.jar first. Nothing will show up, but the server will be running.

Run Client.jar next. If the server is running, the Window will pop up, asking you for input. 

Current commands:
chat - server will respond with “hello, world!”
closeServer - both server and client will shut down

all other commands will get a response: “No Premade Response”
